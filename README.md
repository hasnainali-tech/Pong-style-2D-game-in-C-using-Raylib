# Raylib-CPP-Starter-Template-for-VSCODE-V2
Raylib C++ Starter Template for Visual Studio Code on Windows.
This demo project contains a bouncing ball raylib example program.
It works with raylib version 5.0. Tested on both Windows 10 and Windows 11.

# How to use this template
1. Double click on the main.code-workspace file. This will open the template in VS Code.
2. From the Explorer Window of VS Code navigate to the src folder and double click on the main.cpp file.
3. Press F5 on the keyboard to compile and run the program.

# What's changed
The template now uses folders for better organizion of the files. So, all the source code now lives in the src folder.

# ⚙️ Pong Game Setup Instructions

This guide explains how to **build and run the Pong Game** created in **C++ using Raylib**.  
Follow these steps carefully to run the project without errors.

---

 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
This will download all the project files to your local machine.

2️⃣ Install Raylib
Download and install Raylib for your operating system: https://www.raylib.com

Ensure Raylib is properly linked with your C++ compiler (e.g., MinGW for Windows).

3️⃣ Open Project in Visual Studio Code
Launch Visual Studio Code

Open the folder you cloned in Step 1.

4️⃣ Build the Project
Use the terminal in VS Code or any command line to compile the project:

```bash
g++ src/*.cpp -o build/main.exe -lraylib -lopengl32 -lgdi32 -lwinmm
Make sure all .cpp and .h files are inside the /src folder.

5️⃣ Run the Executable
After compilation, execute the program:

```bash
./build/main.exe
The game window should open and the game will start.

6️⃣ Play the Game
Control your paddle with the keyboard or mouse.

The computer acts as the opponent.

Use the restart button after game over to play again.
